# For dataBase we used mongoDB and uploading the database by running "node data_loader.js"<br>
# Then the server file will run using "npm start or node index.js"<br>
Server will start running localhost:3001<br>
you can see the JSON data onb localhost:3001/products<br>
and now once server starts running you can open the HTML page by typing localhost:3001/home.html<br>


# Things to remember :
For installing mongo type "npm install mongo"
You should see the port number of the mongo by typing "mongo"
To see the database type: <br>mongo<br>
                          show dbs
                      
# Steps:
create a folder of any name
Go to terminal and open the path of that folder:

npm init

npm install

# For installing express Setup:

node data_loader.js


After that you can use this code.. and Start the server by typing: npm start or node test.js
